## Introduction to Sapial AI

### What are the chatGPT limits? Why do we need Sapial AI?

The integration of chatGPT into our lives has brought about profound transformations in the ways we interact with technology. Recognized as one of the pioneering AI systems to attain widespread adoption, chatGPT has served diverse roles across our user base. For some, it has emerged as an interactive conversation partner, while others have utilized it as an educational guide. The business sector has exploited its potential as a research tool, and in some cases, it has even superseded traditional internet search engines like Google.

ChatGPT's functionalities extend to a myriad of tasks such as drafting essays, app creation, coding, resume building, crafting Excel formulas, summarizing content, writing cover letters, and even initiating Etsy businesses.

At first glance, it might appear as though we are at the zenith of technological advancement with chatGPT. However, upon encountering certain limitations, the reality sets in. The AI system, at times, harbors outdated or incorrect information and lacks direct internet access. While chatGPT demonstrates exceptional competence in executing general tasks, it may not always address your specific problems efficiently.

Consider this example: you seek a movie recommendation for a Friday night. Due to the inherent limitations, chatGPT can't suggest new releases, as its knowledge base is limited to films released at least a year and a half ago. And even with specific genre preferences, the AI system typically offers suggestions based on factors like IMDB ratings.

What if we could enhance chatGPT's capabilities? Imagine if it had a memory feature, enabling it to recall all the films you've previously watched, and your feedback on them. Picture chatGPT having the ability to proactively conduct online research. Think about an AI system that understands your preferences and tailors recommendations accordingly. How about chatGPT being able to purchase movie tickets for your favorite cinema and even schedule a taxi to ensure you reach on time?

That's where our concept of a Personalized AI, Sapial, comes into play.

### What are the main Sapial features

**Sapial AI** consists of three parts:
- Python backend
- Javascript middleware
- Client interface

It has a broad introduction to LLMs and Agents through LangChain and HuggingFace transformers
It utilizes prompt engineering patterns to enhance response reachness
It introduces Pinecoin for a short-term and long-term memory management
It has an accedd to the internet to do a series of research before providing you with solution
It uses Agents to learn on the provided information and use it to create contexts
Each prompt is enriched with personallized context
Every successful tasks or research is recorded and results are stored in memory and always available
to be reproduced or used for context

But more importantly - it's build in a user friendly way so no matter of your experience, you can modify
Python backend or JS middleware and adapt your client interface easily, almost without digging into the code. 

The system is available to everyone: Python and Javascript Developers, enthusiasts and even low to no-code engineers. 

### Okay this sounds good, but can you actually show me something?
